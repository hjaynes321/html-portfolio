<h1>The Best Movies According to Holly</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Groundhog Day</h3>
<p>
  Groundhog Day is in fact ground-breaking for what it accomplished. One man
  relives the same day over and over until he becomes a better person. Seemingly
  a comedy at first watch, one realizes through repetition (much like the main
  character) that there is much more to be gleaned through each watch, showing a
  more dramatic side of the film.

<h3>The Princess Bride</h3>
<p>
  The Princess Bride is the story of true love told through a child's book,
  while also brought to life by dynamic characters who exhibit the emotions of
  love lost and found. The movie is an adventure, comedy, drama, and also has
  elements of terror and suspense. The ultimate message is clear, though: live
  your life to love.

<h3>Dumb and Dumber</h3>
<p>
  Although Dumb and Dumber is not a critically acclaimed movie and deemed by
  many to be too inane to receive any true accolades, it is still in fact an
  amusing movie that always makes me laugh. This may be my real "guilty
  pleasure" of a movie, but I stand by the comedic genius of Jim Carrey.
